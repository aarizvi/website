Abbas is a PhD data scientist, computational biologist, and educator. Abbas has strong experience doing data science end-to-end. From data retreival, to data preparation (tidying, reshaping), to exploratory data analysis (visualizations, descriptive statistics), to predictive modeling (machine learning/statistical modeling), to packaging and deployment (using docker as http web services or cloud deployment). Abbas has strong knowledge of molecular and cell biology. Abbas is deeply experienced with the R programming language and given talks at Bioconductor and useR on my open source contributions.
